# Portfolio sample

Developed a dynamic web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrating functionalities such as fetching images from an API, implementing a popup feature for image viewing, 
and incorporating an image slider, all designed to be mobile responsive for seamless user experience across devices


## Pop-up Images
 A pop-up image is a graphical element that appears suddenly on a screen, often triggered by a user action such as clicking a button or hovering over a specific area. It typically overlays the existing content temporarily, providing additional information, context, or functionality. Pop-up images are commonly used in web design, user interfaces,
and digital presentations to deliver visual content in a concise and interactive manner.

## Fetching images from API

Fetching images from an API involves sending a request to a server that hosts images and receiving a response containing the image data. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provide a structured way for applications to communicate with each other, allowing developers to access and manipulate data programmatically.
